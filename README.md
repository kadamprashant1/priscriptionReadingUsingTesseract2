![Project Logo](your-logo.png) <!-- Add your project logo here -->

## Overview

The Prescription Label Reading Deep Learning project is designed to assist elderly people in reading medical prescriptions aloud using a machine learning model. This project uses various libraries and tools to achieve this goal.

## Libraries Used

### 1. pytesseract
   - Description: pytesseract is a Python library that allows optical character recognition (OCR) of text from images. In this project, it is used to extract text from prescription labels.
   - [pytesseract Documentation](https://pypi.org/project/pytesseract/)

### 2. tesseract-ocr-ind
   - Description: tesseract-ocr-ind is an important language package for Tesseract OCR. It provides support for the Indian language scripts, which might be useful for processing prescription labels in multiple languages.
   - [tesseract-ocr-ind Repository](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract-ocr-ind)

### 3. Google Colab
   - Description: Google Colab is a cloud-based Python environment that provides free access to GPUs and is commonly used for training machine learning models. You can leverage its resources for deep learning tasks.

### 4. numpy
   - Description: NumPy is a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is used for array operations and mathematical computations in your deep learning model.
   - [NumPy Documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/)

### 5. matplotlib.pyplot
   - Description: Matplotlib is a Python 2D plotting library. You can use pyplot for creating visualizations and displaying data related to your project.
   - [Matplotlib Documentation](https://matplotlib.org/stable/contents.html)

### 6. cv2_imshow
   - Description: cv2_imshow is a part of the OpenCV library and is used for displaying images in your project. OpenCV is a powerful library for computer vision tasks.
   - [OpenCV Documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/index.html)

### 7. Tacotron2
   - Description: Tacotron 2 is a deep learning model for text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis. It is used to convert the extracted text from prescription labels into audible speech.
   - [Tacotron2 GitHub Repository](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2)

### 8. scipy.io.wavfile
   - Description: The scipy.io.wavfile module is used for reading and writing WAV audio files. It plays a crucial role in handling the audio output generated by the Tacotron2 model.
